This is a school project for practising game programming in Unreal Engine 5.
The game is far from complete, but it is playable.

Logic is in these files:

Blueprints:
BP_Ball (call potting)
BP_Cue (hitting, handball, camera, line trace, rotation)
BP_StartSetUp (backround music, setting up balls in start triangle)

C++:
BasicBall.cpp/.h (class for a ball)
BilliardsPlayer.cpp/.h (class for a player)
Scoreboard.cpp/.h (HUD for score/player info)
ScoreWidget.cpp/.h (score counting, potting)
StartSetUp.cpp/.h (setting up balls in start triangle)

Tekij√§/Maker:
Lasse Martikainen
sound files and ball textures downloaded from the Internet (free use)
